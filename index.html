								<h2><span class="gradient-text">Daniel Mesa</h2>
								<h3>Portland, Oregon</a></h3>
								<p id="main-paragraph"> I'm currently attending Oregon State University as a full time, Postbaccalaureate student, and expect to graduate December 2020. As someone relatively new to computer science, I’m constantly learning new ideas and approaches, to solve problems, every day. I’m excited about the opportunities that challenge my abilities and allow me to grow. 
									<br />
									Prior to the OSU program, I took intro level Computer Science courses taught in Python, which is what led me to apply to the program. I’m eager to start a full-time position so I can continue to expand upon my skills and learn from talented mentors. 
									 <br />
									I’m originally from Miami, Florida, and am  first-generation Cuban-American. I now live in Portland, Oregon, with my partner, Shloimy, and our Mini Poodle, Turtle.
									When not learning, we enjoy the outdoors, reading, and taking Turtle on long walks. Prior to my transition to computer science, I worked as a dentist. Although I loved many aspects of the field of dentistry, in many ways I felt a change was needed. I’m thrilled to be taking the leap towards working in a field that much better suits my personality and outlook. I believe my background has given me a unique and fresh perspective on the future of computer science and where it can take us in the future. </p>

									</ul>
									<p> As a side project, I am building a book trading application using React, Node, Typscript and GraphQL. The app uses Google authentication for user
										signup and login, Google's Geo-location API to allow searching for books, and Cloudinary API to store images. GraphQL requests are handled by
										React Apollo and the Apollo CLI. Finally we use, MongoDB to persist data. It is still a work-in-progress and, using the help of NewLine's Fullstack React Masterclass, I will 
										continue to build and improve the app.

										<li><a href="https://github.com/dmesa89/One-Time-Pads" class="button">GitHub Repository</a></li>
									</ul>
									<p> Five small C programs that encrypt and decrypt information using a one-time pad-like system. These programs combine multi-processing code with socket-based inter-process communication.
										Two of these will programs function as servers, and will be accessed using network sockets. Two will be clients and each one will use one of the servers to perform cipher and decipher tasks.
										The keygen will generate a key of specificed length to use for the encryptiong and decryption process.

										</li>
									</ul>
									<p>An application using React JS that allows the user to create multiple recipes and check 
										each instruction off as it is completed. I wanted to learn React and thought of a side project
										that would be useful for me in my everyday life. As someone who cooks from home, I found it difficult to
										keep track of instructions completeed while juggling multiple recipes. I took the
										idea of a To Do list and expanded it to create this Recipe List application.

									<ul class="actions special">
										<li><a href="https://github.com/williamdam/SoapboxApp" class="button">GitHub Repository</a></li>
									</ul>
									<p> As part of our Capstone course project, I am currently working with a partner on a mobile based, geo-fenced social media platform. The app, Soapbox, will allow users to post a message, which will be
										known as a "shout." The shout will be geo-fenced within a certain radius. The shout can be viewed by any other user within the radius but as soon as the user leaves the radius, the
										shout will no longer be viewable to them. The shouts will also expire within a certain time limit. This project, still a work-in-progress, will allow us
										to advance our skills in iOS development and programming in Swift.

									</ul>
									<p> I began work on a web application that uses Clarafai and Yandex API to describe an image in words and 
										translate those keywords to Spanish. I hope to use this as a feature of a Latin based mobile travel app,
										I plan on building once I have built a solid understanding of cloud application development.

									<p>A program that implements a one player, interactivev, text-based game where a user 
										traverses a forest and has to collect items to build a cabin in the woods.
										The user will run into various foes and friends along the way. The objective is to collect the objects before either dying of exhaustion or foes.
